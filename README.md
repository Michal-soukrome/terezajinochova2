This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Installing dependencies

If you see an npm peer dependency error like `ERESOLVE` mentioning `framer-motion` and `react` when running `npm i`, it's usually because the project has React 19 and an older `framer-motion` version that only lists React 18 in its peer dependencies.

To fix this locally we upgraded `framer-motion` to a 12.x release that supports React 19. If you still hit issues you can temporarily bypass strict peer checks with:

```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

Prefer upgrading `framer-motion` (or the conflicting package) to a version that lists React 19 in its peerDependencies instead of using the legacy flag.
